%description
sr_mechanism_model contains the transmissions used in the robot model. We needed
specific transmission as we're using our own actuator. We also needed to take
care of the joint 0s which combine the distal and middle phalanges.

# In case we're installing to a non-standard location, look for a setup.sh
# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
