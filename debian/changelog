ros-indigo-sr-gazebo-plugins (1.4.0-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Inertia now exact values, with inertia tensor at COM (gazebo and ode support the small values now)
    Removed explicit viscous damping from sr_gazebo_plugin,
    enabled springDamper in each joint (implicit viscous damping)
    changed simulation parameters for stability
    and retuned the controllers, explicitely define friction_deadband for simulated controllers (default is for real hand and is too high)
  * Added shutdown-timeout=1.0 in controller spawner to improve shutdown time
    Added a boolean to stop spinner in gazebo controller manager plugin to improve shutdown
  * using prefix on joints didn't work with gazebo controllers. This is now working
