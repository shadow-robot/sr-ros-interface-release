ros-hydro-sr-mechanism-model (1.3.0-0quantal) quantal; urgency=high

  * fixed sr_kinematics
  * modified how library dependencies are forwarded
  * used world files from sr_grasp_stabilization. resolved deprecation messages
  * added some message dependencies as recommended by wiki
  * fixed build issues that appeared in other PCs
  * Now the test build but don't all succeed yet
  * corrections
  * added install directives and removed old-fashioned bin folder
  * removed ROS_BUILT_TYPE which is unrecommended. Also removed a few redundant lines
  * almost buildable version
  * another step towards catkining
  * first step towards catkinizing
  * Added the muscle hand transmissions
  * Created new simple and joint0 transmission classes for the muscle actuators
  * modified mainpages / manifests / ... for cleaner doc
  * Added a mean to compile with tinyxml without changing the cpp or hpp files
  * Trivial
  * trivial
  * Fixed joint 0 transmission for Gazebo
  * removed the mechanical reduction from the transmissions (it doesn't change much as this factor was set to 1, but it simplifies the code).
    added alpha beta filter to the sr_math_utils
    (lp:863118)
  * reorganizing our 2 repositories: we want the shadow_robot stack to be working on its own. the shadow_robot_etherCAT stack should contain only etherCAT specific code.

  * trying to get the sr_edc_mechanism_controllers to work with gazebo.
  * trivial
  * fixed joint 0s controllers.
  * Updating the documentation.
  * Splitting the tree in two different trees: we want one bzr repository per branch.
